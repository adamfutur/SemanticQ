Introduction  Most contemporary question-answering (QA) systems used in university admissions lack the ability  to accurately classify and interpret diverse education questions, particularly those framed using the  5W1H structure (what, how, where, when, who, why). Th ese systems typically depend on static  information retrieval techniques, which are insufficient for understanding the semantic intent and  structure of domain-specific queries. As a result, they often generate generic, irrelevant responses that  do not address t he sp

Preprocessing  In the preprocessing, we conducted tokenization, removal of stop words, lowercasing, lemmatization,  part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and labeling will be performed on the question data.  • Tokenization segments a question sentence into linguistic units, allowing for a structured  representation of words that form essential grammatical elements [21], [22]  In this study, we use  the spaCy library [23] for tokenization, which effectively handles word boundaries, including sub- words, ensuring better performance in downstream parsing and classification   213 International Journal of Advances in Intelligent Informatics   ISSN 2442-6571   Vol. 11, No. 2, May 2025, pp. 210-226     Soares et al. (Semantic-BERT and semantic-FastText models for education question classification)  • Stop Word Removal is used for uninformative words (e.g., the, is, of ) that contribute little to  meaning [21], [22]. By reducing dimensionality, stop-word removal enhances processing efficiency  and helps improve classification accuracy. Studies indicate that stop-word removal can reduce word  index storage requirements by 30%-50% [22].  • Stemming converts words into their base form using vocabulary-based linguistic analysis (e.g.,  running → run, better → good). This normalization ensures consistency in word representation,  allowing models to generalize better across different word variations [23], [22].   • Part of Speech Tagging (POS) is used to assign grammatical categories to words, providing syntactic  information essential for dependency parsing and question classification [21], [24]. This study uses  Conditional Random Fields (CRF) Tagger from the NLTK library for POS tagging. Standard parts  of speech include: (1) no

This structure allows the  model to capture the semantic roles and relationships accurately, enhancing intent recognition and  classification. To generate the output depicted in Fig. 2, it is crucial to develop an algorithm that utilizes  Python libraries such as spaCy and classifies interrogative words ("where," "who," "why," "what," "when,"  "how") as question words (QW). An essential phase in Algorithm 1 is the processing of sentences using  spaCy (lines 5-23).

otable feature of Fast-text is its use of n -gram sub-words for word embedding, which allows it to  effectively handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and generate corresponding vectors [33], [34]. Its  architecture mirrors the continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) structure of word2vec, consisting of three  layers: the input, hidden, and output layers [35].  In this research, the outcomes of semantic parsing dependencies are utilized as input through the  input layer of the Fast-text model. These inputs are then processed in the hidden layer, where the model  analyzes the data to classify question labels. The re sults of this processing are subsequently presented  through the output layer, demonstrating the model's capability in question label classification.

S-FastText model architecture for Edu-question Classification  The input of this model is a question in text form, such as "What is DIT's vision mission?", and  labels related to the classification of the question. Before the question is processed, semantic parsing is  performed to identify the syntactic and semantic relationships between the words in the question. This  parsing produces the dependency structure of the sentence. For example, the word "what" is marked as  "QW" (question word), "dit" as PROPN (Proper Noun), "vision" and "mission" as NOUN (Noun).  After parsing, the results are fed into the input layer to be converted into a vector representation of  the question sub-words using the Fast -text embedding method. The vector representation values are  passed to the hidden layer, containing several neurons to process information from the word vector and  map it to a more abstract representation.

(Semantic-BERT and semantic-FastText models for education question classification)    Fig. 3. S-FastText model architecture for Edu-question Classification  The input of this model is a question in text form, such as "What is DIT's vision mission?", and  labels related to the classification of the question. Before the question is processed, semantic parsing is  performed to identify the syntactic and semantic relationships between the words in the question. This  parsing produces the dependency structure of the sentence. For example, the word "what" is marked as  "QW" (question word), "dit" as PROPN (Proper Noun), "vision" and "mission" as NOUN (Noun).  After parsing, the results are fed into the input layer to be converted into a vector representation of  the question sub-words using the Fast -text embedding method. The vector representation values are  passed to the hidden layer, containing several neurons to process information from the word vector and  map it to a more abstract representation. The interpretation results from the hidden layer are strategically  directed toward

ansformer encoder layer, and an output layer.    Fig. 4. S-BERT architecture model for Edu-question classification  In the process of dependency parsing semantics, a question sentence is analyzed to identify its  semantic structure and dependency relationships. For example, the sentence "What is the vision and  mission of the Department?" is analyzed to determine the ques tion word (QW), ROOT, NOUN, and  PROPN (proper noun). This is done after going through the preprocessing stage of the sentence. The  dependency parsing semantics results are then processed through an input embedding layer involving  token embedding, segmentat ion embedding, and position embedding. The set of tokens processed  through these three embedding layers, with the exact dimensions, is then added together and passed to  the encoder layer [38].   217 International Journal of Advances in Intelligent Informatics   ISSN 2442-6571   Vol. 11, No. 2, May 2025, pp. 210-226     Soares et al. (Semantic-BERT and semantic-FastText models for education question classification)    Each Token (𝑥𝑥2) embedding in BERT is represented using Equation (3), such as:  𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖= 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖+ 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖+ 𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖   (3)  where 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 is token embedding, 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 is position embedding and 𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖 Is segment embedding:  The input embedding result will be processed by the Transformer Encoder Layer, as seen in  Fig.  5(a). This layer consists of a sub -layer with simple attention, a sub -layer with fully connected  feedforward, and a normalization layer as the output of each sub -layer with Layer -Norm (𝑥𝑥+ 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠(𝑥𝑥)) [39]. Sub-layer (𝑥𝑥) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself [37].  The term "attention" can be described as a function that maps a query and a set of key-value pairs to  an output, where the query (𝑄𝑄), key (𝐾𝐾), Value (𝑉𝑉), and output are all vectors. The output is calculated  as the weighted sum of the values (𝑉𝑉), with the weights given by the query (𝑄𝑄)and the corresponding  key. (𝐾𝐾) According to a compatibi

--- CONTEXT 26088 ---
, each layer in the encoder and decoder construction contains a  Feedforward Network as a connector that will be applied to each position separately. This network  consists of a linear transformation and ReLU activation. The Value of the Feedforward Network can be  obtained through Equation (6) [39].  𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹(𝑥𝑥) = max(0, 𝑥𝑥𝑊𝑊1 + 𝑠𝑠1) 𝑊𝑊2 + 𝑠𝑠2   (6)  where 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹(𝑥𝑥) is the feedforward network value function, 𝑑𝑑𝑠𝑠𝑥𝑥(0, 𝑥𝑥) is the maximum function, and 𝒙𝒙  is the input value.  From the S-Bert process, we obtain a question label based on the semantic context of the sentence.  This label is classified according to the question's semantic context and then processed by the S -Bert  model, which refers to the category or classification of the question asked.

Conclusion  The experimental results demonstrate that classifying educational questions using the S -FastText  and S-BERT models achieves 100% accuracy during pre- training and model validation. Additionally,  we applied both models to pre-train a COVID-19 question classifier, where their performance surpassed  the baseline BERT model used in this study. This highlights the potential of these models to achieve  superior performance compared to traditional approaches. This study can serve as a valuable reference  for future re searchers selecting appropriate models for question classification in question -and-answer  systems. However, additional testing with a diverse and larger dataset is recommended to validate the  robustness and applicability of the models further. This will help ensure the accuracy and generalizability  of both models in real-world applications. Moreover, it would be beneficial to evaluate the models against  other machine learning approaches to compare their performance and identify areas for improvement.  By exp loring these future directions, researchers can co
